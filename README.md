# SQL and Excel project: Cars Sales

## Discription: 
This is a real world dataset about cars sales in many different countries. The dataset has many features or attributes based on which, I measured and analyzed how different manufacturers and cars models perform and compare. For example, we have key features such as manufacturer, model, unit sales, price and some key components of the cars such as engine size, Horsepower, fuel efficiency, fuel capacity and more. First, I downloaded data to excel, conducted a full data cleaning process in which duplicated values where removed, ensured data inconsistency is fixed, applied various functions such as COUNTBLANK and IF(COUNTIF() to check for empty cells and cells with 0 values, respectively. Then, I created a table, clicked on "Analyze Data" in Home tab to further explore and have a simple understanding before any further steps. Finally, I added new tabs and created various graphs and charts such as histogramss, bars and columns charts and in the final tab, I created a simple dashboard by choosing a group of visuals from other tabs which I had just created. As the next step for the project, I imported the dataset to SSMS in .CSV format, created a DB named cars_sales, and wrote 25 important queries to explore and analyze cars data through key SQL skills.
