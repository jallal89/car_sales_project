# SQL and Excel project: Cars Sales

## Discription: 
This is a real world dataset about cars sales in many different countries. The dataset has many features or attributes based on which, I measured and analyzed how different manufacturers and cars models perform and compare. For example, we have key features such as manufacturer, model, unit sales, price and some key components of the cars such as engine size, Horsepower, fuel efficiency, fuel capacity and more. First, I downloaded data to excel, conducted a full data cleaning process in which duplicated values where removed, ensured data inconsistency is fixed, applied various functions such as COUNTBLANK and IF(COUNTIF() to check for empty cells and cells with 0 values, respectively. Then, I created a table, clicked on "Analyze Data" in Home tab to further explore and have a simple understanding before any further steps. Finally, I added new tabs and created various graphs and charts such as histogramss, bars and columns charts and in the final tab, I created a simple dashboard by choosing a group of visuals from other tabs which I had just created. As the next step for the project, I imported the dataset to SSMS in .CSV format, created a DB named cars_sales, and wrote 25 important queries to explore and analyze cars data through key SQL skills. 
## Files in this project: 
- car_sales_project.sql: Has all SQL Queries that were conducted in SSMS
- queries_results.pdf: A PDF file of how queries results look when clicked on "Run" for each query in SQL
- car_sales_excel.xlsx: excel file of dataset and all visuals and dashboard
- Note: when you click on excel file, it shows as "Row data" and when you click on it, it downloads to your computer as excel file
- Once you open it on your computer, it will likely asks if you trust this file, the reason is because it is a public domain excel file on kaggle that many people use, but you can edit it, write in it, save your own version as you like

## Project Key Findings and Analysis 
- Mercedes-B among most expensive cars, with highest price among all cars, at $85,500
- Porsche, Mercedes-B and BMW among most expensive, but most desirable cars at the same time
- Ford models had the most units sold at 540561, with Toyota at second place at 247994
- Toyota and Honda had the best retention value among all cars, with average %75 - %80 retention value
- Carrera Cabrio (Porsche cars) had best resale value among all models, with $67,550 and retention value of %90
- Dodge and Chevrolet among cars with largest engine size, with Dodge (Viper models) as high as 8 L or CC
- Vehicle types vary when it comes to units sold, with cars and passengers both recording high and low sales 
- Toyota and Honda record best fuel efficiency marks, with Dodge, Lexus and Ford on the other side
- Models such as Ram Van, Navigator and Escalade among the best when it comes to fuel capacity
- Toyota and Nissan among highest manufacturers in regard to numbers of models offering cars for sale
