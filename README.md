# SQL and Excel project: Cars Sales

## Discription: 
This is a real world dataset about cars sales in many different countries. The dataset has many features or attributes based on which, we measure and analyze how different cars and models perform and compare. For example, we have key features such as manufacturer, model, unit sales, price and some key components of the cars such as engine size, Horsepower, fuel efficiency, fuel capacity and more. First, I downloaded data to excel, conducted full clean process in which duplicated where removed, ensured data inconsistency is fixed, applied various functions such as COUNTBLANK and IF(COUNTIF() to check for empty cells and cells with 0 values, respectively. Then, I created a table, clicked on "Analyze Data" in Home tab to further explore and have a simple understanding before any further steps. Finally, I added new tabs and created various graphs and charts such as histograms, bar and columns charts and in the final tab, I created a simple dashbaord by choosing a group of visuals from other tabs which I had just created. As next step, I imported the dataset to SSMS in .CSV format, created a DB named cars_sales, and wrote 25 important queries to explore and analyze cars data through key SQL skills.
